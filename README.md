********** Mental-Health-Assistance-Chatbot **********

A conversational AI chatbot designed to provide empathetic mental health support using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Mental Health Assistance Chatbot is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to provide empathetic and contextually relevant support to individuals seeking mental health guidance. Built using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 Turbo, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Speech Recognition, this chatbot simulates counseling conversations to assist users in expressing their thoughts and emotions in a safe and accessible manner. Mental health concerns are often met with barriers such as stigma, financial constraints, and limited access to professional services. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering a scalable, anonymous, and cost-effective mental health support system.
         
This chatbot is not a replacement for professional therapy but serves as a first-line intervention for individuals seeking anonymous and accessible mental health support
